                      <li>They make requests for money due to a personal emergency</li>
                      <li>They are never able to meet in person or video call</li>
                      <li>They want to move off of the dating site/app to another messaging platform</li>
                      <li>They get angry if you ask questions or donâ€™t follow what they ask</li>
                      <li>They offer to show you how to quickly and easily make money</li>
                      <li>They want you to keep your relationship secret from friends and family</li>

                    Protecting yourself from scams involves being vigilant and taking certain precautions.
                    Always verify the identity of the person or organization contacting you, never share personal information
                    unless you are sure it is safe, and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.
