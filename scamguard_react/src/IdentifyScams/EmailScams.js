                    It is likely that an email is a scam if it:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Includes generic greetings</li>
                      <li>Claims to be from an organisation but the email address does not match
                        <ul>
                            <li>For example it is a free webmail address (gmail, outlook) or the organisationâ€™s name is misspelt</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Includes a link that does not match the URL it goes to
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hover over a link, but do NOT click on it to investigate the actual URL</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>Asks you to provide personal information</li>
                      <li>Includes spelling and grammatical errors</li>

                    Examples of scam emails include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Claiming you are due to receive a large sum of money</li>
                      <li>An invoice for a product you never bought</li>
                      <li>Claiming your account will close soon unless you reactivate it</li>

                        Always verify the identity of the person or organization contacting you, never share personal information
                        unless you are sure it is safe, and report any suspicious activity to the authorities.
