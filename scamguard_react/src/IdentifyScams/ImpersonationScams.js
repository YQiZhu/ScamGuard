                    It is likely that you are encountering an impersonation scam if:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The message from an organisation is unexpected</li>
                      <li>There is an urgent request for you to take immediate action</li>
                      <li>You are asked to click on a link</li>
                      <li>You are told there has been an unauthorised transaction on your account or asked to confirm a payment you did not make</li>
                      <li>You are threatened with serious consequences such as arrest or deportation if you donâ€™t respond</li>
                      <li>Details in the communication such as a URL or an email address do not match the organisation they are supposed to be from</li>
                      <li>You are asked to make a payment to a different account then you expect</li>
                      <li>A family member or friend contact you from a new number asking for financial help</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
