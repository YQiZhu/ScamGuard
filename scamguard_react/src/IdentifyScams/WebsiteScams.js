                <p>
                    It is likely that you are interacting with a scam website if it:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Has an unusual URL such as containing unnecessary words, extra characters, replaces letters with numbers or has words misspelt such as a company name</li>
                        <li>Prices items significantly lower compare to other sites</li>
                        <li>Requires unusual payment methods such as gift cards or cryptocurrency</li>
                        <li>Contains only generic, positive reviews</li>
                        <li>Has poor quality design and spelling and grammar errors</li>
                        <li>Is missing a contact information section</li>
                        <li>Is missing a shipping and return policy</li>

                <h4>Fake Websites Scamming Australian Shoppers by Imitating Popular Brands</h4> {/* Story Title */}
                <p>
                    The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has seen a rise in reports of fake websites mimicking popular Australian clothing brands such as Gorman, Peter Alexander, and RM Williams. These fraudulent sites, often advertised on social media, offer significant discounts on items, luring shoppers to enter their payment information. Victims either receive counterfeit products or nothing at all. The scam websites are sophisticated, using stolen branding, logos, and even Australian Business Numbers (ABNs) to appear legitimate. Companies like Meta and TikTok are working to remove these fake ads from their platforms, while the ACCC advises consumers to be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true and to use secure payment methods.
