            <h2>Website Scams</h2>
            <p>Website scams are fraudulent sites designed to steal personal information, financial details, or money from unsuspecting users. These sites often mimic legitimate ones, like banks or online stores, to appear credible. Common types of website scams include phishing sites that steal login credentials, fake e-commerce sites that take payments without delivering goods, and investment scams promising high returns. Users should always verify a website's authenticity before entering sensitive information to avoid falling victim.</p>

                      <li>Requires unusual payment methods such as gift cards or cryptocurrency</li>
                      <li>Contains only generic, positive reviews</li>
                      <li>Has poor quality design and spelling and grammar errors</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Research the organisation or person youâ€™re in contact with before providing any personal information or giving money</li>
                      <li>Do not rely on reviews written on the website, search for independent reviews on other sites </li>

                      <li>If there is a secure, authenticated way to reach the organisation such as an app or portal use this</li>
                      <li>Look up the domain age using <a href="https://whois.domaintools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whois Lookup</a>

                        <p>
                            The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has seen a rise in reports of fake websites mimicking popular Australian clothing brands such as Gorman, Peter Alexander, and RM Williams. These fraudulent sites, often advertised on social media, offer significant discounts on items, luring shoppers to enter their payment information. Victims either receive counterfeit products or nothing at all. The scam websites are sophisticated, using stolen branding, logos, and even Australian Business Numbers (ABNs) to appear legitimate. Companies like Meta and TikTok are working to remove these fake ads from their platforms, while the ACCC advises consumers to be cautious of deals that seem too good to be true and to use secure payment methods.
